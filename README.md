Morehead Captioning
UNC Glass Explorers

This app is designed with the Morehead Planetarium as an aid to those that are hearing impaired by displaying transcriptions to Google Glass.
The goal is to have two modes for the two types of shows done at the planetarium:
(1) transcribe script from a pre-written show to be displayed at corresponding timestamps
(2) capture speech in real-time to be transcribed and displayed immediately for live shows
