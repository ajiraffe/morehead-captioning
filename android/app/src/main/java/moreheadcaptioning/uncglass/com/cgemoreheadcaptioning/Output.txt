TEXT ACROSS DOME: Sometime in the future....We hear footsteps echoing in a corridor.VOICEOVER by former Space Fleet Commander JACK LARSON begins simultaneously with OPENING CREDITS.
00:00:30;03
 I thought I was done with space...
00:01:09;13
...until I got the call from Warren Trout.
00:01:13;23
I'd hung up my wings from Space Fleet Command 10 years ago. 
00:01:18;11
But when a multi-billionaire like Trout calls to discuss a 'top-secret world-changing space mission', you get ... curious.
00:01:40:28
Absolutely, Arturo, no problem. Pull up the year-end figures for South America and forward them to Arturo. Arturo? They're on their way.
00:01:48;19
Mr. Trout? Jack Larson.
00:01:50;29
I know. Larson, I'll get straight to the point. Bring up the eco-presentation.
00:01:55;20
Which one? Global Disasters Three or -- ?
00:01:58;19
Never mind, I'll do it. Leave us.IT ASSISTANT throws up her hands, starts to exit.
00:02:03;27
Nice to meet you.
00:02:05;08
Likewise.
00:02:06;17
Good luck. LARSON looks after her as TROUT punches code into computer. Visuals take shape on a screen behind TROUT's desk.
00:02:11;23
For centuries, humans have been bent on destroying the planet. Turning lakes into deserts... (Visual: Aral Sea with grounded ships)Pumping poison into the atmosphere...(Visuals: Bumper to bumper cars; smog and industrial	smokestacks)
00:02:20;03
Cutting down forests to make plywood and pool cues... (Visuals: Logging in Congo River basin)The list goes on and on. Some see disaster. Trout Enterprises sees opportunity! (Images on screen dissolve to graphic: "UIUMO" )
00:02:30;06
Our business philosophy? UIUMO. 
00:02:33;00
"UIUMO"? 
00:02:34;07
(interrupting)It's an acronym.???"Use it up, move on".Image on screen morphs so UIUMO is vertical, with each letter the beginning of a word
00:02:36;27
And that's where you come in.Why bother any more with a planet well on its way to being used up when there's a fortune waiting for whoever finds a new home for humanity...(UIUMO image dissolves to image of SPACE)...out there!During following dialogue, space image dissolves to renderings of TROUT's vision of a colony somewhere in the Solar System: Huge clear domes on a barren landscape, futuristic vehicles, lots of artificial environment-generating equipment surrounding domes, etc. At the end of TROUT's next speech, a "WELCOME TO TROUTLAND" sign that is vaguely reminiscent of the famous Las Vegas sign is added to the picture.
00:02:48;28
Larson, your assignment is to search the solar system, locate a totally unique site for colonization - and stake a claim for Trout Enterprises.TROUT pushes button and the wall behind him opens to reveal a launching pad hidden on the grounds behind TROUT's business complex ... and the huge rocket ready to blast LARSON off on his adventure.
00:03:00;14
You leave tomorrow.DISSOLVE TO:
00:03:20;15
THEN:Int. SpacecraftLARSON is strapped into spacecraft seat. ???Countdown and mission control communications are heard. 
00:03:38;03
T minus 10 and counting... Countdown continues to zero during following exchange.
00:03:40;27
All set, Commander?
00:03:42;07
Good to go and cool as a cucumber. I've done this before you know.
00:03:46;25
Roger that!Countdown endsSubwoofers!!!!!(n/a) mISSION CONTROLWe have liftoff. LARSON begins to shake and groan audibly as we experience launch with him.Shot of digital gauges featuring velocity gauge. Readout approaches and eventually tops 40,000 kilometers/hr.Closeup of LARSON's face: shaking, pained and distorted by rocket's tremendous acceleration.CUT TO:Space!We see LARSON's craft in space. Rocket stages fall away and float around the dome.CUT TO:INTERIOR SPACECRAFTQuiet and peaceful after thunder of launch. ???LARSON removes his helmet, rolls his neck, and groans, reacting to the stress of launch experience. 
00:05:00;25
Mmm. Maybe I'm getting too old for this.
00:05:05;17
(voice filtered so it sounds like it's coming from helmet communication system)I'm not! That was fun!LARSON reacts with surprise as a smaller figure in a space suit floats out from a storage bay.
00:05:07:27
Whoa!!! Who are you? What are you doing here???
00:05:10;19
Engaging artificial gravity.IT ASSISTANT crashes to spacecraft floor/deck. 
00:05:14;04
(voice still filtered)Ouch.(pulls off helmet)
00:05:15;24
Wait a minute! I remember you! You're Trout's computer assistant!
00:05:21;24
(smiles, extends her hand)Hi. Ashley Trout.
00:05:24;08
Ashley Trout?
00:05:25;28
Yep, I'm his daughter. I've wanted to go on this mission since Dad first started talking about it. 
00:05:32;04
Uh...Unacceptable! No hitchhikers! I'm taking you home to your dad!
00:05:36;20
Oh, don't worry about Dad. I left him a note.
00:05:39;22
(starts to say, but ASHLEY interrupts)A note?
00:05:40;23
Yep! So. Dad wants to find somewhere humans might be willing to live besides Earth, right? Okay.Beemer? Before LARSON can speak, our final principal character is revealed: an anthropomorphic on-board robot computer interface shuffles out, beeping and blipping. He moves swiftly past LARSON to ASHLEY, LARSON has to dodge to get out of the way.
00:05:51;05
What the heck is that?
00:05:53;01
(indignant that he doesn't know)Duh! It's a BMR 1200 interface unit! Beemer, activate Solar System Review.BEEMER'S head spins, blips and beeps, cabin lights begin to dim.
00:06:01;10
Wait a minute! I'm the only one authorized to issue voice commands on this ship!
00:06:06;27
Yeah, I know. That was the first thing I took care of. 
00:06:09;29
What? What are you talking about?
00:06:12;00
I hacked the computer.
00:06:13;21
What??
00:06:14;16
I've been hanging out with Dad's engineers since I was four. Amazing what you can learn if you pay attention to smart people. Beemer? Resume review!BEEMER blips and beeps. We hear the warm, friendly voice of the integrated onboard computer as a huge holographic image zooms to center of visual field.
00:06:23;13
What the...???
00:06:29;12
A solar system is a system of planets and other bodies that orbit a star, such as our own Sun.
00:06:35;16
The Sun is large enough to hold a million Earths and generates its tremendous heat by the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium at its core.LARSON and ASHLEY (and our audience) now find themselves in an environment that is remarkably like a full dome planetarium experience. They are surrounded by a three-dimensional VR re-creation of the solar system, with accurate orbital planes, etc.As ASHLEY calls up each grouping, the appropriate planets or other solar system members zoom from their place in the overall display and hover, labeled and oversized, in center of visual field. Labeling could include temperature range, distance from Sun, etc.??? ???ASHLEY is talking nonstop, rapidfire science, with an occasional personal comment revealing her subtle, wry sense of humor. Her knowledge base -and her ability to articulate it- are truly impressive. LARSON is impressed and, for the moment at least, speechless.Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, appropriately labeled, take "center stage". Their moons and rings are clearly visible.
00:06:44;02
(speaking VERY rapidly)Alright, alright, Computer - we're not going to be living on the Sun, right? 
00:06:48;26
Zoom up the planets! 
00:06:51;13
Now. The gas giants are OUT - way, way out in the solar system! So it takes them years to orbit the sun! 
00:06:58;20
And you know, "gas giant" is really a lame nickname. 
00:07:02;24
Okay, they're big, up to hundreds of times larger than Earth, and they may seem like just huge balls of hydrogen and helium gas, but most of their mass is liquid! 
00:07:14;00
they have massive gravity that squeezes the heck out of their interiors, heating things up and causing all sorts of wacky weather. 
00:07:22;00
AND -- big problem -- no solid surfaces! So where are you gonna land? The intense pressure deep inside these big guys would squash you like a bug! 
00:07:31;28
The rings are nice, though, aren't they?She waves her hand and the gas giants return to their appropriate place in the display. BEEMER ducks and dodges as they fly past.
00:07:35;08
(to BEEMER)Show us the terrestrials!BEEMER blips and blips. His head spins as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars take 'center stage'. They are all labeled and, where they exist, their moons are also visible.(n/a) LARSON(still dazzled and a bit in awe)Okay, that's very impressive --
00:07:39;19
(ignoring him)Ahhh... the terrestrials. Earth- like planets - sort of. 
00:07:44;12
I mean, yeah, they're composed mainly of rock and metal so at least they all have solid surfaces where you might build a colony. 
00:07:51;10
And they're way closer to the sun than those big guys...(she gestures toward the Gas Giants)...so they have way smaller, way quicker orbits around the sun. She motions to Mercury, the other terrestrials dim.
00:08:01;17
Mercury is the closest to the sun - and the smallest planet in the solar system.Mercury takes "center stage".
00:08:06;11
Hey, little fella! He's small,dry, barren, cratered - but heeee's hot! Too hot! Hot enough to melt lead on the sunny side! No colony there!ASHLEY flicks Mercury out of the way. Venus takes center stage.
00:08:19;18
Venus? Ha! You know people used to call Venus "Earth's twin sister" because they're about the same size? 
00:08:26;21
BUT the greenhouse effect from that atmosphere makes Venus even hotter than Mercury! Clouds of sulfuric acid, crushing, poisonous atmosphere... 
00:08:37;00
So long, Sister.(She flicks Venus out of the way)(n/a) LARSON All right, kid, that's enough --
00:08:39;05
And then there's Mars... AND our own Moon...hmmm... okay, we'll talk.Instead of flicking Mars and the Moon away, she gently pushes them to the side.(n/a) LARSONNice show. Now --
00:08:46;05
(still ignoring him)All righty! What's left? Asteroids? Comets? Oh, I know! Beemer! Send in the dwarfs!Pluto and other dwarf planets parade across the central viewing area as a comet shoots overhead, and asteroids float through space. Music (and BEEMER's blips and beeps) should underscore the circus atmosphere. The VR effect is so realistic that this time even LARSON ducks and dodges to get out of the way, along with BEEMER.(n/a) LarSONWhoah! Stop!This lively display is interrupted by crackling static -- it's a video transmission from TROUT! The solar system VR show grinds to a halt. TROUT's angry face appears on a stationary monitor. Lights restore in spacecraft cabin.
00:08:55;03
Larson? Larson, come in! Is my daughter on board that spacecraft?
00:08:59;25
Aaaa...Well, yes sir, as a matter of fact--
00:09:01;28
Hi, Dad. Did you get my note?
00:09:04;15
You are so grounded, young lady! Larson, you're to turn that rig around and return here immediately! And you, Ashley --
00:09:12;11
What? Sorry, can't hear you Dad, you're breaking up...She grabs BEEMER by some part of his anthropomorphic anatomy and shakes violently to create static and distorted image on stationary monitor.
00:09:17;29
(shouting, as if she has a bad cell phone connection)Bye, Dad. I'll call you later.
00:09:20;00
(as his image and voice fade and then disappear)Ashley??!!
00:09:23;02
(to LARSON)Okay. Where were we? Beemer?
00:09:26;02
Whoa! Stop! You heard the boss, we're going home.
00:09:29;04
Nope. Can't. I hacked the computer so we can't go back until we've visited at least three really cool sites in the solar system where my Dad might set up a colony. 
00:09:38;16
What?? BEEMER reacts. LARSON wheels around to his control console.
00:09:40;14
Computer! Manual override! ...Computer!LARSON punches some buttons on console, BEEMER honks, nothing happens.
00:09:44;06
Sorry, Commander, not gonna happen. I thought my dad might order us back, so I programmed things so even I can't undo the command. We may as well make the most of it, right?She gives LARSON a big grin. ???LARSON looks at her for a moment, dumbstruck.DISSOLVE TO:MOS scene of LARSON, ASHLEY, and BEEMER. At first, ASHLEY and LARSON are arguing, but at appropriate point in VO we see that LARSON grudgingly capitulates. Then various planet, moon, and asteroid holograms are displayed as LARSON and ASHLEY discuss. We hear LARSON's VO: 
00:10:03;21
Ashley Trout was going along for the ride whether her dad or I liked it or not. And she was right - there was really nothing to do but make the most of it.As LARSON and ASHLEY continue their MOS discussion, holographic images of the Moon and Mars, respectively, hover between them. 
00:10:15;08
We both knew that Mars and our own Moon were the most obvious candidates for human colonization....LARSON and ASHLEY's discussion becomes audible. Holographic image of the Moon hovers between them.
00:10:23;00
It's obvious! It's the closest solar system object to Earth!
00:10:27;27
Yeah, BUT it's so ... barren! Covered with impact craters and mountains! And no real atmosphere, so it's boiling hot where the sun shines, but in the shadows it's wicked cold!
00:10:39;29
True. But there's water --
00:10:42;00
Oh, yeah, great. There's only a little, and what little there is is mostly frozen inside craters near the north and south poles!
00:10:50;10
Okay! What about Mars?Holographic image of Moon is replaced by Mars.
00:10:53;23
Also pretty close. Atmosphere? Check. Subsurface water ice? Possibly. Primitive life may even exist under the surface!
00:11:03;25
Okay, but there's...-
00:11:04;10
And visually, it's VERY interesting! Largest volcano in the Solar System, a canyon that could stretch across most of the US! 
00:11:14;14
Okay, the atmosphere is super thin, with almost no oxygen, but still --
00:11:19;08
Stop! We're wasting our time.
00:11:22;18
We are?
00:11:23;12
Yes! Governments and corporations have been talking about the Moon and Mars for years, and there are missions already underway. (ASHLEY sweeps the Mars hologram away; BEEMER beeps and ducks)
00:11:31;11
I know my dad, and he's going to want something... different, something... exotic, something he can really put his own Trout Enterprises stamp on! So -She stops suddenly, thinks a moment, then makes 'yes!' gesture.
00:11:44;12
Yes!!! 
00:11:45;06
What?Beemer(quizzically)Blip? Beep?
00:11:45;25
Moons!
00:11:46;24
(throwing up his hands, exasperated)We just ruled out the Moon!
00:11:49;00
Not 'the Moon'! Other planets' moons! We're not the only planet with a moon, you know! BEEMER blips and the four gas giants and their moons take shape between LARSON and ASHLEY. Discussion fades to MOS again as we hear LARSON V.O. [Perhaps we go to long shot of spacecraft in space for first part of LARSON's V.O., then return to scene in spacecraft for second part?]
00:12:02;26
Ashley was right, of course. There are more than a hundred moons orbiting the different planets in the solar system, some of them larger than our own lunar neighbor.
00:12:12;19
Working with information from space probes and earth orbiting telescopes, we finally settled on three planetary moons to visit,
00:12:20;10
all of which have abundant sources of water molecules - an important consideration for potential colonization.Holographic visuals of Titan, Callisto, and Europa, each labeled appropriately.???Labels for Callisto and Europa should include "water - liquid and frozen". Label for Titan should include "water ice"???Lights restore in spacecraft cabin. 
00:12:28;00
(to ASHLEY)So we're in agreement. We start with Saturn's moon Titan, then catch two of Jupiter's moons, Callisto and Europa, on our way back to Earth.LARSON punches buttons on command console.
00:12:39;26
Hang onto your breakfast.We share a special effect hyper-speed experience -- something to make the traversing of impossible distances in our time frame conceivable.During the experience, the computer voice calmly announces:
00:12:55;06
Approaching asteroid belt.ASHLEY grabs controls in co-pilot seat.
00:12:57;18
Asteroid Belt! Oh! Beemer? Cancel hyperdrive, sound the alarm and give me manual control! I've sooo got this!LARSON gives her a look.
00:13:06;03
I created an asteroid game in the simulator back home! I'll bet I can pilot us safely through, even if it's bumper to bumper asteroids! Hang on!
00:13:15;07
Cool your jets, kid. Common misconception. Asteroid belt's mostly empty space. LARSON calmly reaches over to console and pushes "Dismiss" button. Warning bells stop.Extreme zoom out to see the ship as a tiny dot floating in space with perhaps one asteroid out in the distance. Back to INT. SPACECRAFT???LARSON settles back into captain's chair. He looks over at ASHLEY, who is looking appropriately chagrined.
00:13:23;15
(with a chuckle, shaking his head)"Bumper to bumper asteroids..." He punches hyperspeed commands into console again.
00:13:27;08
Resuming course for Saturn moon Titan! Hyperspeed effect. Then, as we approach Saturn, the spacecraft slows to 'normal' speed. We get visuals of Saturn and its moons and rings. Spacecraft is approaching Titan.
00:13:42;29
9 Hours lat approaching saturn moon: Titan
00:13:47;05
Saturn's rings. Most likely created when one of the planet's icy moons was shattered by an impacting comet or asteroid. 
00:13:54;24
Or ripped apart by Saturn's massive gravity. Either way, those chunks of water ice now orbit like billions of baby moonlets, endlessly circling 'round their huge mother planet with their big sisters. Magnificent.
00:14:14;00
As we approached Saturn's largest moon, Titan, I couldn't help thinking it looked like a giant floating... Cut back to spacecraft interior.
00:14:20;27
It looks like a giant floating orange!
00:14:24;21
(chuckling)Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. 
00:14:27;06
Hey, do you know that Titan is larger than the planet Mercury?
00:14:31;20
Yes I do.
00:14:33;06
Okay. Just checking.???You know, scientists think conditions on Titan may be similar to conditions on Earth during its early history, and that primitive life could be present--ASHLEY's thought is interrupted as the ship plunges into deep orange haze, visible through spacecraft window.
00:14:45;21
Huh! Can't see a thing down there!
00:14:48;29
That's not surprising. Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere.LARSON, ASHLEY, and BEEMER are looking out spacecraft window.
00:14:53;23
Why is it... orange?
00:14:55;27
Orange haze a result of chemicals in atmosphere.  
00:14:59;10
Hang on, I'm taking us below the haze.LARSON punches in command. Ship travels below clouds; suddenly rain audibly pelts exterior surface of spacecraft window.
00:15:07;20
A rainstorm???
00:15:09;23
Rain composed of liquid methane. Approaching methane lake.Ship travels through storm; methane lake now visible.
00:15:15;11
(putting it together)Ohhh... methane rain creates methane lakes. Makes sense. Hey, maybe we could go wind surfing. [she's kidding, of course]
00:15:23;09
(chuckling and checking gauges)I wouldn't recommend it. We're showing a surface temperature of 178 degrees below zero. Would you wanna live there?
00:15:30;20
Mmm. Cold. Suffocating atmosphere. Methane rain. Thick orange haze all the time....ASHLEY and LARSON look at each other and shake their heads.
00:15:39;07
(together)Nah.
00:15:41;09
(punching commands on console)On to Jupiter!Hyperspeed effect again. 
00:16:05;00
Five hours laterapproaching Jupiter Moon: Callisto
00:16:08;06
Although they have neighboring orbits around the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are still hundreds of millions of kilometers apart, even at their closest point. 
00:16:18;01
Without the hyperdrive engine in our ship, traveling between them would have taken months.Spacecraft emerges from hyperspeed. ???Jupiter visible through window. 
00:16:25;10
Ooooo, pretty! Why is it so colorful?
00:16:29;20
Well, Jupiter--
00:16:30;16
(interrupting)Jupiter's colors may come from chemical reactions in the planet's clouds and giant storms, interacting with ultraviolet light from the sun. 
00:16:38;06
Yeah, I was just about to say that.
00:16:41;06
Approaching Jupiter Moon Callisto.Callisto becomes visible through spacecraft window. LARSON, ASHLEY and BEEMER peer out at the heavily cratered moon.??????Suddenly a meteoroid whizzes past ship.
00:16:47;04
Yikes! Was that a meteoroid?Meteoroid smashes into Callisto's surface.
00:16:59;13
Ouch! 
00:17:01;08
Heading in for low altitude fly by.LARSON punches commands on console. Ship zooms close to surface, then levels out. Heavily cratered surface of Callisto is clearly visible as spacecraft zooms above.
00:17:04;17
Whoa! This moon's really gotten whacked! What's up with that?Before LARSON can answer, COMPUTER VOICE jumps in:
00:17:08;27
Because there is no air, wind, flowing water, or volcanic activity to alter Callisto's surface, many of Callisto's craters may date back almost to the formation of the solar system -- making them 4 billion years old! 
00:17:22;24
Almost as old as you are, Larson.
00:17:25;01
Ohhh, sounds like somebody wants to go back in the storage bay for the rest of the trip.
00:17:29;14
Haa! (mockingly)
00:17:30;28
Sensors showing abundant surface ice. 
00:17:33;21
But it's so dark! 
00:17:35;24
Dark appearance may be due to large amounts of rocky material mixed with surface ice.LARSON, ASHLEY, and BEEMER stare out at barren surface of Callisto.
00:17:42;00
Pretty bleak. n/a LARSONReminds me of my apartment.
00:17:43;15
And with all that ice, I'll bet it's cold, too.A beat as LARSON, ASHLEY and BEEMER gaze at Callisto. Then:
00:17:46;12
Too cold for a colony. Moving on to Europa.Cut to spacecraft in space, leaving Callisto. We pull WAY back until spacecraft grows so small as to be invisible -- and we see Saturn and Jupiter, with their moons.	
00:17:55;24
(CONT'D)Compared to the distance between Saturn and Jupiter, it was a relatively short hop from Callisto to Europa. 
00:18:02;07
Both moons are made up of lots of water ice -- so it was surprising to see how different they looked.Cut back to interior of spacecraft as it approaches Europa, which grows larger and brighter.
00:18:08;26
Check this out. LARSON operates cabin illumination dimmer switch. Lights in spacecraft go dim; very bright Europa visible through spacecraft window.
00:18:12;12
It's so... bright!
00:18:15;13
It doesn't have all that rocky material mixed with the surface ice like Callisto does. So it reflects a LOT of sunlight.Spacecraft zooms closer, revealing the criss-cross "veins" on Europa's surface.
00:18:22;06
(struggling to find the right comparison)It looks like a ... big ... bright ... bloodshot eyeball.
00:18:28;09
(laughs at Ashley's comparison)Yes it does!
00:18:30;12
Europa's strange appearance may be the result of the combined gravity of Jupiter and its other large moons pulling and squeezing Europa and cracking its icy crust. 
00:18:39;25
Ahhhhh.
00:18:40;18
Mineral-rich water from a huge subsurface ocean seeped up into the cracks and froze, creating the criss-crossing network of lines. LARSON, ASHLEY, and BEEMER are all gazing out spacecraft window at Europa's surface.
00:18:48;21
I wonder if there could be any kind of life down there...BEEMER beeps excitedly. Lights dim in spacecraft; COMPUTER VOICE uses holographic capacity to illustrate the following presentation:
00:18:55;23
The development of life as we define it requires liquid water, energy, and molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. 
00:19:03;17
Impacting comets from the outer solar system could provide such molecules.
00:19:08;11
Heat from the gravity-squeezing of Europa could supply the energy and melt interior ice to supply liquid water. 
00:19:16;23
Hm...Interesting possibility.... 
00:19:19;23
Yeah, for life forms that could survive in those low temperatures. But it's far too cold for humans to start moving in.   BEEMERBlip. Beep. Whirrrr.Lights restore in spacecraft.
00:19:27;16
Okay. So that's it. Three potential colonization sites; all interesting but all rejected. Can we go home now Ms. Navigation System Hacker?
00:19:37;27
(nodding)We could...but you know, Jupiter's moon Io is just around the corner --
00:19:42;18
No. Absolutely not. Don't even think about it.
00:19:46;01
But we're so close -- Io has to be one of the most awesome sights in the solar system! Don't you want to see it?
00:19:53;21
Well...
00:19:54;10
Oh, come on! You know you do! Please please please please please!BEEMER(echoing ASHLEY's pleading)Beep beep beep beep beep!!!
00:20:00;28
Okay! We'll swing by for a quick peek -- but then home to Papa, no more argument.
00:20:07;10
Yes!!BEEMERBeep!Long shot of spacecraft in space, headed toward Io. It should be clear that Io's orbit is closer to surface of Jupiter than those of the other two moons.
00:20:15;08
Oh. My. Gosh.Cut back to interior of spacecraft, and we see what ASHLEY is reacting to. LARSON, ASHLEY, and BEEMER are gazing out spacecraft window in awe. Io is truly spectacular, with volcanic eruptions, lava lakes, sulfur dioxide geysers.
00:20:18;04
We gotta get a closer look! 
00:20:19;26
Okay. But not too close.Ship zooms closer to Io, eventually traveling at approximately 300 kilometers above surface.
00:20:24;21
(observing the colorful terrain)Looks like the pizza I had last night for dinner.
00:20:26;22
Ha! That's because the volcanoes are spewing sulfur compounds all over the surface! There are hundreds of them! Why are they so active?
00:20:36;27
Like Europa, Io is stretched and squeezed by a gravitational tug of war between Jupiter and its other large moons, generating tremendous heat within the moon. 
00:20:46;24
Erupting lava temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius.
00:20:50;28
Wow. That's hot enough to melt copper. Or gold. Or silver.(turns to BEEMER)Or you.BEEMERBlip.
00:20:58;09
Caution! On collision course with eruption plume! 
00:21:02;06
(gasp!)Oh, no!
00:21:02;28
Hang on!LARSON grips controls tightly and ship plunges through volcanic sulfur plume. Blinding moment. Ship is buffeted by impacting eruption cloud but emerges safely and stabilizes.Suddenly lights flash, computer voice grinds to halt, warning sirens sound. Emergency lighting comes on, bathing the spacecraft cabin in an ominous red glow. BEEMER beeps, spins and collapses.
00:21:16;05
(not our friendly computer!)Warning. Entering radiation danger zone. System failure. Radiation! System failure! Radiation! 
00:21:21;25
No, no, no, no, no....
00:21:36;16
What's going on? What happened?
00:21:25;12
Jupiter's radiation belt [zone?]! High energy particles trapped in the planet's magnetic field! 
00:21:30;08
So ...?
00:21:30;25
So we got too close!(aside, to computer)Computer! Reverse direction!(to Ashley)The radiation is strong enough to kill an unprotected human in seconds! And it's frying our electronics! (calls to computer again)Status report!COMPUTER VOICE's voice is now weak and slow, perhaps like a 45rpm record played at 33 1/3. 
00:21:42;26
Ship's systems compromised. Power levels at 20% and declining. 
00:21:47;09
Bottom line! Can we get back to Earth?
00:21:49;19
(after weak blips and beeps)Power ... insufficient. 
00:21:51;15
Oh, no!
00:21:52;12
Ashley! Can we redirect power to the hyperdrive?
00:21:55;00
(thinking fast)Ummm - I think I can patch something together.
00:21:57;29
Do it! 
00:21:58;13
Okay, hold on!ASHLEY leaps into action, pulling wires from console, re-patching connections and punching commands into computer console, all with intense focus. She is in her element. 
00:22:00;18
(with great urgency, speaking rapidfire to herself)Okay! Bypass the damaged circuits, patch in the backup power units, don't need this... don't need that ...Lights in spacecraft flicker and flash. Electrical sounds - hissing, zaps, and pops. BEEMER begins to beep.
00:22:12;11
Got it!At that moment the lights come back up in spacecraft cabin, BEEMER is resurrected, and computer voice returns to normal.
00:22:12;28
Hold on! Computer! What've we got?		00:22:14;19 COMPUTER VOICE(after blips and beeps)Hyperdrive power levels now sufficient for Earth return - but manual control required.LARSON heaves sigh of relief.
00:22:21;05
Guess I'll be doing this the old fashioned way.Larson takes controls and engages hyperspeed.Hyperspeed effect. When effect ends 'big blue marble' Earth visible through spacecraft window. (Grows larger and larger throughout following dialogue as spacecraft approaches.)LARSON heaves a sigh and gives ASHLEY a nod and thumbs up, signaling his approval and respect. ASHLEY smiles. ASHLEY discovers that she has left out an important looking piece of electronic equipment in her modification of the console -- probably looks something like a distributor cap with an octopus of wires.
00:22:56;01
Oh, look. Guess we didn't need this after all.She tosses the part over her shoulder. Larson laughs. ???An image of TROUT appearing on computer display.
00:23:01;15
Larson! Ashley! Come in! Come in!
00:23:04;03
Trout?
00:23:04;23
Larson! We received an automated distress call! Are you all right? Ashley?
00:23:09;05
Yes, sir, it was a close call, but we're good now - and headed home. 
00:23:12;17
Thank goodness. I knew I chose the right man for the job. 
00:23:15;29
Well, sir, actually Ashley's the one who saved us. 
00:23:19;14
Ashley saved you??
00:23:20:17
She's really quite a remarkable young woman.The moment is suddenly interrupted by:SPACE JUNK COLLISION!!!!!Explosion!!!???Spacecraft has collided with random piece of space junk!!???Spacecraft tumbles through space (Vomit Alert) Following rapid dialogue exchange takes place as spacecraft tumbles.
00:23:23;18
What was that??
00:23:24;20
Hold on!
00:23:28;00
Space junk! We really took a hit!Computer warning sounds.
00:23:30;15
Main propulsion, engine, and power modules destroyed. BEEMER makes desperate beeping noises. 
00:23:33;22
That's bad. Real bad.Larson presses buttons, desperately trying to fix the situation as the countdown begins.
00:23:35;25
Oh no! Ummmmm...Umm... Wait!
00:23:40;16
What?
00:23:41:04
(spoken like she has an idea)Computer! Release main cabin escape pod!
00:23:43;26
Escape pod? What escape pod?Cut to long shot of damaged spacecraft in space. Main cabin (bridge) dis-engages, rest of spacecraft drifts away.Cut back to spacecraft interior. 
00:24:18;21
Escape Pod release successful. LARSON takes controls.
00:24:22;02
(shaking his head as he stabilizes escape pod)Space junk! I can't believe it. What are the odds?
00:24:26;21
Although there are tens of millions of pieces of debris in orbit around the Earth, the odds of collision are relatively small. Still --
00:24:33;23
It was a rhetorical question! TROUT image crackles onto screen again.
00:24:37;07
WHAT IS GOING ON UP THERE???!!!
00:24:38;26
It's fine, Dad, we're okay. 
00:24:41;15
Ashley! I've been terribly worried about you! Space is a dangerous place!
00:24:45;19
I know, Dad, but listen -- we're safe, we're coming home, and I have good news. I know exactly where the colony should be.BEEMER and LARSON look at her quizzically.
00:24:53;17
You do?
00:24:54;07
Yep. Computer? Image these coordinates.She types at console. A holographic image of a planet begins to form. It grows more recognizable until:
00:25:01:25
But that's?? that's??
00:25:03:07
Yep. Earth.???Dad, if you want to keep exploring space, great! That's cool. But don't do it because you've given up on Earth! 
00:25:11:06
But...Trout Enterprises has always - 
00:25:13:08
Dad, forget UIUMO! Don't use it up and move on! Fix it!
00:25:18:01
But --
00:25:18:08
Dad, you know I'm right! That should be the real mission! 
00:25:25;00
When I knew we were safe, and I saw Earth out there, and I knew it was home, I was just so ... happy! 
00:25:33;15
A colony anywhere else in the solar system would need artificial everything, and it still wouldn't be nearly as wonderful as Earth! 
00:25:43;09
You'd have to supply oxygen and water and protection from harmful radiation from space. 
00:25:49;23
You'd have to build domes and constantly control the pressure and temperature inside them. 
00:25:55;28
You could never step outside the dome just to go for a walk without a ton of equipment! (holographic Earth has become quite large; it really is beautiful)
00:26:02;17
I mean, why try to re-create this amazing oasis, with water and oxygen and everything else Earth already has to offer, in an environment as hostile as Space? 
00:26:19;07
There's no way to replace Earth! So we have to work together to fix it! 
00:26:26:03
But it will take a massive coordination of resources! And then  the politics...
00:26:30:21
Dad, it's worth it!
00:26:33:07
Well...maybe... ASHLEY winks at LARSON, then shakes BEEMER again. TROUT image breaks up.
00:26:36:16
Oh, sorry! I'm losing you again Dad. We'll work it all out when I get home. Together.TROUTBut ...
00:26:43:05
Bye, Dad. See you soon. Love you!Another shake, and TROUT image fades.Silence for a moment. Earth hologram fades. BEEMER, LARSON, and ASHLEY look at real Earth out window of spacecraft.
00:26:51:19
So what do you think of the new mission? Are you on board?
00:26:56;08
Well, maybe I can keep my retirement on hold for a while. But your dad --
00:27:02;11
He'll come around. He loves a good challenge.
00:27:05;03
Must run in the family.
00:27:06;22
Yeah. Who knows, Commander? Maybe next time you'll be working for me.
00:27:12;28
(smiles)Ha. Strap in, kid. We're heading home.Space ship speeds into earth's atmosphere.FINAL CREDITS/end of show
